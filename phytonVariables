# words in programming are called strings

# 5 = integer => int

#"hello"= word => string

# booleans = 0,1 example true/false

# variables are case sensitive

a = 4
A = "Bob"
print (a,A)

# A WILL NOT OVERWRITE a

# = in programming means "Assigned to" Exple 5 is assigned to variable x

# LEGAL VARIABLE NAMES

# A variable name must start or underscore character

# IT CANNOT START WITH A NUMBER

# IS CASE SENSITIVE AND CANNOT CONTAIN ALPHA-NUMERIC CHARACTERS (a-z, 0-9)

# CAN ALSO MEAN "NOT EQUAL TO"(AGE IS # age)

# python allow you to assign many values to multiple variable in 1 line

#concatenation is to combine two strings, you can use the + operator

#Phyton Boolean
#It uses two values True or False, it evaluates any expression to True or False, phyton then evaluates ang gives a boolean answer

#Evaluate a string and a number, example function "bool()"

#OPERATORS
#Examples 
x = 2
y = 5

#print

print (x % y)
print (x // y)

#The floor division // rounds the result down to the nearest whole number

print(x ** y)

#Same as 2*2*2*2*2
