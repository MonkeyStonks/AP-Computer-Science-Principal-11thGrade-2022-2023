'''# Functions
A function is  a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameter, intoa function. A function can get data as a result

# Creating a function

# In phyton, a function is created using a def keyboard

# Example
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")
my_function()

def my_function (fname):
  print (fname + " Joaquin")
my_function("pizza")

# Parameters or arguments

# The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing. Information that are passed into a function

# A parameter is the variable listed inside the parenthesis in the function definition

# An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called

# Example
def my_function (fname, lname):
  print(fname + " " + lname)
my_function("Carlos", "Campuzano")'''

# Phyton Class

# To create a class, use a keyword class

# Create a class name named MyClass, with a property named x:
class MyClass :
  x=5

# Create an Object

# We can use the class name MyClass to create an object

# Create an object named g1, and print the value of x:
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)

# The _init_() Function 

# Use the _init_() function to assign values for name and age : 

# Create a class named Person, and use the _init_() function to assign values for name and age :

class Person():
  def __init__ (self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
p1 = Person("John", 36) 
print (p1.name)
print (p1.age)

# Note The _init_ function is called automatically everytime the class is being used to create a new object

# Phyton Inheritance

# Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherit all the methods and properties from another class

# Parent class is the class name being inherited from, also called base class

# Child class: the class that inherits from another class, also called drived class

# Any class can be a parent, so syntax is the same as creating another class 

# ex: create a class named Person, with firstname and lastname properties, and a printname method 

class Person: #Parent class
  def _init_(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname
  def print(self):
    print (self.firstname, self.lastname)
  
# Use the person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method 

x = Person ("John", "Doe")
x.printname()
#Child class

# To create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent class as a parameterwhen creating the child class

# Create a class named Student which will inherit the properties and methods from the Person class

class Student (Person):
  pass 

# Ex: Use the Student class to create an object, and then execute the printname method
  
x = Student ("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()
